DATABASE SCHEMA
================================================================================

USER TABLE
-----------
- id (Integer, Primary Key)
- username (String, Unique, Not Null)
- email (String, Unique, Not Null)
- password (String, Hashed with Bcrypt, Not Null)
- resume_text (Text, Optional)
- created_at (DateTime, Auto-timestamp)
- Relationships: One-to-Many with Skill table

SKILL TABLE
-----------
- id (Integer, Primary Key)
- name (String, Not Null)
- user_id (Integer, Foreign Key → User.id)
- source (String, Default 'manual', Values: 'manual' or 'extracted')
- created_at (DateTime, Auto-timestamp)
- Relationships: Many-to-One with User table


MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH
================================================================================

1. TF-IDF VECTORIZATION
   Purpose: Convert text into numerical vectors
   Process:
   - Takes user skills and internship requirements as text
   - Converts to numerical vectors using TfidfVectorizer
   - Captures importance of each skill across all internships
   - Stops words removed to focus on meaningful terms
   
   Example:
   User Skills: "Python, JavaScript, React"
   → TF-IDF Vector: [0.45, 0.67, 0.82, ...]
   
2. COSINE SIMILARITY
   Purpose: Measure similarity between user and internship requirements
   Formula: similarity = (A · B) / (||A|| × ||B||)
   - Ranges from 0 to 1 (converted to 0-100% for display)
   - Compares user skill vector with each internship vector
   - Returns match percentage for ranking
   
   Example:
   User Skills vs Internship A: 0.78 → 78% Match
   User Skills vs Internship B: 0.65 → 65% Match
   User Skills vs Internship C: 0.92 → 92% Match
   
3. NLP SKILL EXTRACTION
   Tool: spaCy (en_core_web_sm model)
   Process:
   - Performs Named Entity Recognition (NER)
   - Identifies PERSON, ORG, PRODUCT, GPE entities
   - Matches extracted terms against skills_master.csv
   - Returns list of recognized technical skills
   
   Example:
   Resume Text: "Experienced Python developer with React expertise..."
   → Extracted Skills: [Python, React, JavaScript, ...]

4. GAP ANALYSIS
   Logic: Compare user skills with internship requirements
   Process:
   - Split required skills string by comma
   - Find missing skills (in requirements but not in user skills)
   - Calculate match percentage = (matched_count / total_required) × 100
   
   Example:
   User Skills: [Python, JavaScript, SQL]
   Required: [Python, JavaScript, React, Node.js, SQL]
   Missing: [React, Node.js]
   Match %: (3/5) × 100 = 60%

TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE
================================================================================

Application won't start:
1. Check Python version (3.8+)
2. Verify all dependencies installed: pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Check for syntax errors: python -m py_compile run.py
4. Ensure port 5000 is available

Resume upload fails:
1. Verify PDF is valid and not corrupted
2. Check file size (max 16MB)
3. Ensure PDF has extractable text (not scanned image)
4. Check /uploads folder has write permissions

Skills not extracted:
1. Verify spaCy model: python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
2. Check skills_master.csv exists in dataset/
3. Ensure resume text contains recognized skills
4. Check database has write permissions

Analysis shows no recommendations:
1. Ensure skills are added (manually or from resume)
2. Check internships.csv exists and has data
3. Verify internship skills match user skills (case-sensitive)
4. Try adding more skills for better matching

Login not working:
1. Verify email and password are correct
2. Check database exists: instance/career_mentor.db
3. Try registering a new account
4. Check browser cookies are enabled

Database errors:
1. Delete instance/career_mentor.db
